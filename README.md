# 📊 GoldenMart Sales Intelligence – SQL Data Analysis Project

## 🧭 Overview

This project showcases an advanced SQL-based analysis of GoldenMart’s sales ecosystem using **Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**. It covers a wide range of retail insights such as time-based sales trends, customer segmentation, product performance benchmarking, and category contribution analysis.

The core objective was to transform raw transactional data into strategic KPIs using SQL queries — all written inside the [`sql_data_analysis_project.sql`](./sql_data_analysis_project.sql) file.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Analyze total and cumulative sales trends over time (daily, monthly, yearly)
- Understand customer purchasing patterns and segment them by behavior
- Benchmark product sales against historical and peer performance
- Evaluate category contributions to overall business
- Create a reusable SQL view for dashboarding/reporting purposes

## 🗃️ Datasets and Tables Used

| Table Name            | Description                                                   |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `gold_fact_sales`     | Transaction-level data: date, amount, quantity, customer, product |
| `gold_dim_products`   | Product metadata: name, category, cost, price                 |
| `gold_dim_customers`  | Customer metadata: name, age, city, birthdate                 |

## 🧠 SQL Concepts & Features Applied

- Joins (`LEFT JOIN`) to combine dimension and fact tables
- Aggregations: `SUM()`, `COUNT()`, `AVG()`
- Window Functions: `LAG()`, `AVG() OVER`, `SUM() OVER (PARTITION BY...)`
- Conditional logic: `CASE WHEN`, category bucketing
- Date functions: `YEAR()`, `MONTH()`, `DATEDIFF()`, `DATETRUNC()`
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for modular query building
- Views for report-ready data models

---

## 🧮 Key Analytical Logic

### 🕒 Time-Based Sales Analysis
- **Daily, Monthly, Yearly sales trend**
- **Cumulative revenue** with running totals
- **Moving average** of average product prices (yearly)

### 🛒 Product & Category Insights
- **Yearly product performance** vs average
- **YOY (year-over-year)** product growth classification: `growth`, `decline`, `stable`
- **Category-level contribution %** to total revenue

### 👥 Customer Segmentation
- Classification into:
  - `VIP customers` – high spenders with long-term history
  - `Regular customers` – consistent but moderate spenders
  - `Beginner customers` – new or low activity
- Lifespan analysis: first vs last purchase
- Age group segmentation: under 20, 20–29, 30–39, etc.
- Average monthly spend, recency, and product diversity

### 📊 Reporting View
- Created view `gold_report_customers` that consolidates:
  - Orders, lifetime value, lifespan, age group, order frequency
  - Customer segment classification
  - Readiness for dashboard integration

---

## 📈 Sample KPIs Generated

- 🔹 **Monthly Sales Volume** and **Customer Acquisition Count**
- 🔹 **Top Contributing Categories** by revenue percentage
- 🔹 **Product-wise yearly sales vs average** and **YOY change**
- 🔹 **Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)** and **Recency Scores**
- 🔹 **Average Order Value (AOV)** and **Monthly Spend Rate**

---

## ✅ Final Insights & Recommendations

- 📌 **VIP customers (high spend, long relationship)** should be prioritized for loyalty campaigns
- 📌 Certain categories contribute disproportionately to sales — recommend product bundling or cross-selling
- 📌 Customers aged 30–39 are most active; marketing can be targeted accordingly
- 📌 Products with declining YOY sales need price reevaluation or promotional support
- 📌 Use the `gold_report_customers` view as a direct input to Power BI or Tableau dashboards
